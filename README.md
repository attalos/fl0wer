# FL<sub>0</sub>wer Reasoner

This project contains the [implementation](reasoner) and [evaluation](evaluation) of the prototype FL<sub>0</sub> reasoner named FL<sub>0</sub>wer.

These are the results of my Bachelor-Thesis [Entwurf und Implementierung eines Systems zur Entscheidung von Subsumption in der Beschreibungslogik FL0](https://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/research/theses/2017/Mic-Bac-17.pdf) which is based on the theoretical work [An Automata Based Approach for Subsumption w.r.t. General Concept Inclusions in the Description Logic FL0](https://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/research/theses/2015/Pen-Mas-15.pdf)

Further improvements on the reasoner and the evaluation have been done after the thesis.

TODO: 
 - [ ] write something about "why use a fl0-reasoner"
 - [ ] show some results here
 - [ ] improve reasoner documentation
 - [ ] improve evaluation documentation
